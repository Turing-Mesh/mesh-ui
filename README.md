## About the Project

Mesh is the [capstone project](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/capstone.html) for students of the 2011 cohort at Turing School of Software & Design. It is a full-stack application built by a FE team and BE team from the 2011 Turing cohort. The overarching goals of this project were to get experience working on a full stack team and to learn and implement a new stretch technology along the way. In a nutshell, the application itself is a project feedback tracker for fellow students at the Turing School of Software & Design.

### MVP

The MVP goal of this application is to offer students a centralized location for finding their project feedback for any project they complete in each of the four modules they move through during their time at Turing. 
 
The userflow for this goal involves:

   - Logging into the student dashboard
   - Selecting a module and project to view
   - Finding the corresponding project feedback, including:
       - Rubric categories, scores for these categories, and any associated instructor comments
       - An overall score and any final comments included by the instructor
       - A student notes section

### Extensions

The extension goal of this application is to offer instructors with a convenient, standardized way to grade student projects and provide student feedback. 

The userflow for this goal would involve:

   - Logging into the instructor dashboard
   - Selecting a student, a module, and a project to view
   - Filling out a form auto-populated with the rubric categories associated with the project selected
   - Submitting their feedback through the Mesh app

## Learning Goals
- Learn and gain fluency with the Vue framework and Vuex for global state management
- Work with a full-stack team to create a ...
<!-- TODO finish these bullets -->
- [Something about continuous integration with Travis CI]
- [Insert verb here] end-to-end testing with Cypress
- Use best practices for UI/UX, including wireframes, user personas, and testing

## Future Iterations
- Finish rubric component and POST request that would allow instructor to leave new feedback for their current students.
- Build feature that would allow instructors to search for students by name.
